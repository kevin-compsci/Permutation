# Permutation
Permutation on "Sequences of Characters"

A Basic and naive program that computes various permutations on a given sequence of characters (strings, char arrays, etc.). This program does not consider unique permutations so repeated permutations can occur. However, this oddity can easily be resolved to improve complexity. Completed in 2016 by Kevin.
