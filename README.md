# Permutation
Permutation on "Sequences of Characters"

A Basic and naive set of programs that computes various permutations on a given sequence of characters (strings, char arrays, etc.). These programs do not consider unique permutations so repeated permutations can occur. However, this oddity can easily be resolved to improve complexity. Completed in 2016 by Kevin.
